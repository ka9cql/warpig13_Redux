Don't forget to check out the "direwolf" git repository, place it in Warpig's /home/direwolf directory, and BUILD IT!

IF YOU ARE USING DON (KJ6FO's) FSQ CODE - don't forget to grab his KJ6FO_FSQ.cpp (et al) from his "Flying Squirrels" github account, change the callsign to YOURS and then BUILD IT. You must also symbolically link the KJ6FO_FSQ executable to the /usr/local/bin directory.  (That executable is the one used in the 'testFSQ' shell script.)
