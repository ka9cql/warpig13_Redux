# warpig13_Redux
Warpig-13 baseline, with modifications to eliminate the Baofeng 888 radio and use PiFmAdv to do APRS over GPIO

NOTE: This repo takes advantage of many tools, including DireWolf and PiFmAdv.

Direwolf is used to generate an audio file that gets played over 2 meter APRS using PiFmAdv.

Any current version of Direwolf would work.

PiFmAdv can be found here - https://github.com/miegl/PiFmAdv

NOTE: I HAD TO MODIFY PiFmAdv SOURCE CODE to *NOT* continually loop the audio on EOF.
If you do not use my modified code, your APRS transmitter will JAM THE RADIO FREQUENCY!
